# STUDIO UI - Minimal / atomic UI library

This project was based on [materialui.com](https://material-ui.com/), and some custom stuff like [react-select.com](https://react-select.com/)

Goal here was to adapt material design styles to match the styles with an existing design guidelines in a legacy project, in order to start a progressive migration to React.
